Added class TestWritable.java shows performance difference of Writable vs. Java
Serialization

First: Java Serialiation showing 399 bytes for Objects Address and TestObject. TestObject contains Object Address giving you a minimal object graph. 
Second; Writable showing 64 bytes of storage for AddressWritable and TestObjectWritable which are writable versions of Address and TestObject
Third: serializing the AddressWritable and TestObjectWritable using std. Java streams shows 434 bytes vs. 64 bytes. 

These are for fake objects, real objects would be have a bigger difference.
